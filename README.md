=======

The code for our website.
Contact [Brent](https://github.com/zenbrent) for help understanding or updating it. I try writing good documentation, but I sometimes forget.

## About
  This website is made using [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org), using a typical [Express](http://expressjs.com) REST setup. The database is
  [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org). It's hosted on [WebFaction](http://www.webfaction.com/).  If you want to run it on you own computer,
  download and install Node, I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). Download the code for the site (using either Git,
  or click the "Zip" button on the [repository's homepage](https://github.com/lorkas/Website/). Go to the folder in the command line,
  `npm install` then `npm start`. You only need to do `npm install` the when you first download the site and when you update it.
  
  We are currently cleaning the information on the site up, and working on adding user accounts so members can maintain their own profile information.
