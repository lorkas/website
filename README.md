Website
=======

The code for our website.
Contact [Brent](https://github.com/zenbrent) for help understanding or updating it. I try writing good documentation, but I sometimes forget.
Also, we have a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/khe3G44K/lorkas-website) with tasks that need to be completed.

## About
  This website is made using [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org), using a typical [Express](http://expressjs.com) REST setup. The database is
  [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org). It's hosted on [WebFaction](http://www.webfaction.com/).  If you want to run it on you own computer,
  download and install Node, I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). Download the code for the site (using either Git,
  or click the "Zip" button on the [repository's homepage](https://github.com/lorkas/Website/). Go to the folder in the command line,
  `npm install` then `npm start`. You only need to do `npm install` the when you first download the site and when you update it.
