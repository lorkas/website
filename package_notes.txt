This is an explanation of all the packages used.
All the server packages are in package.json, they are installed and updated by npm.
All the client packages are in public/scripts. They are manually maintained. Something to automate this would be nice, but no biggie.

Framework:
  express
    the framework for the whole site - the most popular one for node.js
    Good api documentation: http://expressjs.com/
    Express uses connect middleware - all the app.use stuff is middleware.
    Connect docs are at: www.senchalabs.org/connect/
  passport
    it's what lets us use google, facebook, s.o., etc for logins.
  passport-*
    adapters for different oauth providers. passport-local is not for oauth, but just so local logins go through the same, easy interface.
  bcrypt
    for password hashing
  connect-mongo
    Use mongodb as a session store.
UI:
  jade
    So much nicer than html. 
    Their github page has all the docs: https://github.com/visionmedia/jade - their actual website sucks.
  stylus
    It makes css not suck as bad.
    http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/
  nib
    Extensions for stylus.
    http://visionmedia.github.com/nib/

Programming:
  coffee-script
    Uncomplicated javascript. It compiles into javascript, and is soo much easier to read and write.
    Great docs, and the "Try Coffeescript" thing is VERY useful.
    http://coffeescript.org
  colors
    So you can console.log things in color. e.g. console.log "I'm thinking of something orange!".orange
  async
    For asynchronous flow control. There's billions and billions of libs to do this, but I like async the best.
    Node uses asynch design patterns instead of threads. If you're reading or writing to disk or sending stuff over a network, you use pipes (preferred) or async (not bad).
    https://github.com/caolan/async
  underscore
    Functional programming for javascript.
  connect-coffee-script
    It just makes using coffeescript easier.





Things I may pull in later, as needed:
  UI:
    bifocals
      View library with support for asynchronous sub-views (aka partials) and interchangeable rendering systems.
    morpheus
      animations
    jquerypp
      jquery supplement
  Account:
    request
      HTTP request client (get, put, post..) e.g. for oauth

  Progamming:
    one
      convert node.js packages for the client. Like browserify, but I think this is better.
    bilby
      hardcore functional lib
