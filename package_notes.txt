Things I may pull in later, as needed:
  UI:
    bifocals
      View library with support for asynchronous sub-views (aka partials) and interchangeable rendering systems.
    morpheus
      animations
    jquerypp
      jquery supplement

  Account:
    request
      HTTP request client (get, put, post..) e.g. for oauth

  Progamming:
    one
      convert node.js packages for the client. Like browserify, but I think this is better.
    bilby
      hardcore functional lib
